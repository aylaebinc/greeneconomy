<p>PG&amp;E’s data had some minor formatting errors that were manually corrected:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 2014 Q3 Gas, fields “Total Therms” and “Average Therms” renamed to match the fields in all other datasets.</li>
<li>For 2017 Q4 Electricity and 2017 Q4 Gas, duplicate September values were removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, because of privacy regulations, the PG&amp;E data has many gaps in industrial and agricultural energy usage. Even though industrial energy usage may be a significant contributor to emissions, as the ICLEI report suggests, without more consistent data we decided to leave industrial energy analysis out of our report.</p>
<p>After downloading and aggregating the PG&amp;E residential and commercial data by month and year, we converted electricity and gas energy usage to tCO2e. For gas, we converted therms to tCO2e based a factor from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> (assuming that PG&amp;E’s natural gas emits at this rate, and that it doesn’t change from year to year). For electricity, we converted kWh to tCO2e for the appropriate year using the table provided by PG&amp;E in their <a href="http://www.pgecorp.com/corp_responsibility/reports/2019/en02_climate_change.html">2019 Corporate Responsibility Report</a>, under the table titled “Benchmarking Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Delivered Electricity”. Because the latest emissions data is 210 lbs CO2 per MWh for 2017, and SB 100 signed into law September 2018 requires state energy agencies to adopt a 100 percent clean energy by 2045 planning goal, we assume the emissions factor will decrease by 7.5 lbs CO2 per MWh each year, resulting in a value of 202.5 for 2018.</p>

<p>The graphs below illustrate that total energy usage (in kBTU) for electricity and gas has stayed roughly level across the last six years, but given that electricity has become cleaner through renewable power sources, the overall carbon footprint of electricity has decreased dramatically in comparison to gas.</p>

<p>The following graph plots monthly tCO2e for electricity vs. gas. The peaks in gas usage occur in January, corresponding to heating load, and the peaks in electricity usage occur in July, corresponding to cooling load, and overall decreasing as previously noted. As we’ll explore in a later section, electrification of air and water heating in buildings may be a particularly effective strategy to shift the peak gas consumption to less carbon-intensive electricity loads.</p>

<p>Note that heating and cooling loads, which appear to contribute to significant seasonal variation within years, is also heavily dependent on the specific weather in any given year, typically measured in heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs). A more accurate comparison of annual energy consumption would control for change in HDDs and CDDs year-to-year; a more accurate forecasting of energy consumption into the future would also factor in climate model predictions of future HDDs and CDDs.</p>
<p>We used the <a href="https://cal-adapt.org/tools/degree-days">Cal-Adapt Degree Day tool</a> to collect HDDs and CDDs for Stockton from 2010 to 2018, and on to 2040, using the average simulation (CanESM2) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario (in which global GHG emissions peak around 2040, then decline). The graph below shows the data from Cal-Adapt, as well as linear trendlines, with a clear overall upwards trend for CDDs (meaning that temperatures are rising and more cooling power is needed), and a clear overall downwards trend for HDDs.</p>

<p>The following table shows historical 2013-2018 annual energy usage per capita (residents for residential energy, jobs for commercial energy) per degree day (HDDs for gas, CDDs for electricity), and the graph that follows shows these four energy use factors with downward trends. This may be through a combination of changing building energy efficiency as well as changing building utilization (e.g. more or less space per occupant), though we don’t have the data to be able to separate these two factors.</p>

<p>A full forecast of energy usage will also depend on predicted changes in resident and job populations, which will lead to more buildings and more energy used in buildings, predicted changes in building energy efficiency and utilization, predicted changes in weather, and many other factors that are outside the scope of this analysis. One last available dataset to incorporate into our understanding of energy use relates to buildings.</p>
