<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Origin-Destination Commute Analysis</h2>
<p>As seen in the previous section, transportation is the largest single contributor of GHG emissions in Stockton, <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/ghg-inventory-data">as is true for all of California</a>. Within this sector, passenger vehicle emissions are by far the largest portion, and these are relatively easy to relate to their direct proxy, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and normalize by drivers to understand current driving behavior. Specifically, commutes (driving to work) are the largest share of passenger vehicle emissions (other driving to/from amenities will be analyzed separately), and we can access data as recent as 2017 to understand commute patterns of Stockton residents to different job destinations inside and outside of SJC. What we find is that VMT is significant, and significantly locked in to the nature of job opportunity in faraway locations like the Bay Area. This means that VMT reduction is a crucial component in any overall green economy strategy, and it can be tackled directly through transportation strategies like public transit and EV deployment, but also indirectly by attracting high-quality jobs to Stockton, which on average will shift workers from faraway jobs to local jobs, thereby reducing VMTs. A comprehensive origin-destination commute analysis, as performed below, helps us quantify total VMTs attributable to commuting as well as model the specific impacts of different direct or indirect VMT reduction strategies.</p>
<p>In this section, we first examine the distribution of job locations for SJC in comparison to neighboring counties, as well as Stockton in particular. The following section will then analyze vehicle miles traveled for these commute trips.</p>
<div id="county-level-analysis-1" class="section level3" number="2.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> County-level Analysis</h3>
<p>Our key dataset is from <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics</a> (LODES), which can be downloaded by state and is available up to 2017.</p>
<p>Some reported workplaces in LODES are as far away as Los Angeles County and are likely data errors (e.g. the company headquarters is in Los Angeles but the actual workplace is much closer, or the employee works from home). These workplaces are left in the datasets shown in this section, but are removed later when calculating VMTs.</p>
<p>The LODES dataset also disaggregates jobs by three age groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of jobs of workers age 29 or younger</li>
<li>Number of jobs for workers age 30 to 54</li>
<li>Number of jobs for workers age 55 or older</li>
</ul>
<p>It also disaggregates jobs by three wage tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of jobs with earnings $1250/month or less</li>
<li>Number of jobs with earnings $1251/month to $3333/month</li>
<li>Number of jobs with earnings greater than $3333/month</li>
</ul>
<p>It also disaggregates jobs by three broad sectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of jobs in Goods Producing industry sectors</li>
<li>Number of jobs in Trade, Transportation, and Utilities industry sectors</li>
<li>Number of jobs in All Other Services industry sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows the counts of jobs in these subcategories that are held by SJC residents traveling to a workplace in SJC or its top 14 contiguous neighboring counties. The percent jobs shown are percentages of SJC employed residents; so of all SJC employed residents, 48% work within SJC.</p>

<p>The following table compares SJC with neighboring counties in terms of the percentage of jobs held by its residents that are “local”, meaning within the same county. This figure mirrors Figure @ref(fig: compare-jer), which showed J/ER ratio for the same counties, all stagnating or in decline. The figure below provides one contribution, which is declining local jobs for local residents, not just for SJC but for its neighboring counties.</p>

<p>The following table shows the counts of jobs in these subcategories for the top 15 contiguous neighboring counties to Stockton, including SJC. Note that the jobs being counted are those held by Stockton residents who are traveling to a workplace in the listed regions. 41% of Stockton employed residents work within Stockton. These jobs could be considered valuable for avoiding the “brain drain” of local talent to other places, as well as for creating the smallest transportation footprint.</p>

<p>The following maps help to visualize the specific distribution of Stockton residents’ jobs in the categories of age, earnings, and industry sector.</p>
<p>37% of younger (under 29) Stockton employed residents work within Stockton, and another 15% work outside of Stockton but within SJC. Beyond that, there are higher concentrations of these younger workers in Sacramento and Alameda County compared to other neighboring counties.</p>

Figure 2.10: Top 13 counties where Stockton residents work, not including SJC - percent of overall jobs for Stockton workers with earnings $1250/month or less located in workplace. Data from LODES, 2017.

</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>38% of higher-wage (greater than $3,333/month) Stockton employed residents work within Stockton, and another 12% work outside of Stockton but within SJC. Note these percentages are lower than the percentages of lower-wage jobs that remain local. Beyond that, there is a higher concentration of these high-wage workers in Alameda County compared to other neighboring counties. Perhaps targeted marketing of businesses that are providing these higher-wage jobs in Alameda County to move to Stockton could be an effective investment.</p>

Figure 2.14: Top 13 counties where Stockton residents work, not including SJC - percent of jobs for Stockton residents in All Other Services industry sectors located in workplace. Data from LODES, 2017.
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~\)</span></p>
<p>While LODES origin-destination data doesn’t provide job types at a granularity lower than the three broad industry sector categories in the previous three maps, one possible assumption to make is that the distribution of NAICS industry sectors in a destination block group, which is available through the separate Workplace Area Characteristics dataset from LODES, is the same distribution for specifically Stockton residents who work in that block group. Using this assumption, we created estimates of the locations of specific types of industries and wage levels for Stockton employed residents.</p>
<p>The percentages in the table below should be interpreted as the % of overall jobs held by Stockton residents of that industry sector and wage tier that are based in San Joaquin County (the remainder being based in other counties). Particularly notable here are the low-percentage estimates of high-wage jobs in sectors generally related to the “knowledge economy”: Finance and Insurance (38%), Information (28%), and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (19%). Also notable is the low percentage of high-wage jobs in Construction (35%), which may include specialized building trades such as solar installation. These percentages are relative to an overall 64% of high-wage jobs being based in SJC, which suggests that the best jobs in these notable industries are significantly underrepresented in the local economy.</p>
