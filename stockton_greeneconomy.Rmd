# Introduction

The Office of the Mayor in Stockton, CA is seeking to differentiate the City's investment opportunities, including potential capital from public (e.g. Transformative Climate Communities), private (e.g. Opportunity Zones), and philanthropic (e.g. foundations) sources, through the lens of **green economy**. The challenge at hand is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of Stockton's assets and opportunities across a wide range of industry, infrastructure, development, and policy domains which could be marketed as green economy investment opportunities, thereby enabling City representatives to prioritize and drive evidence-informed discussions with investors, as opposed to agendas being driven by one-off outside interests. In particular, the City is focused on leveraging such a framework to target and scope a green demonstration project in the short-term (2019-2020), which already has committed capital, that generates the most useful short-term results, both in realized environmental and economic benefits and in attracting further investment interest.

City Systems has conducted a research activity with the following outcomes:

1. A repository of information about green economy investment opportunities in Stockton, including relevant technical review, case studies of implementation in other cities, key risks/challenges, and estimated ranges of possible environmental and economic benefits per dollar of investment.
2. Communication materials for the City of Stockton and partners to use in investor outreach.
3. A detailed design and implementation plan for a green demonstration project, informed by consensus-building discussion with City-identified stakeholders throughout the research phase, and likely to have initiated before the conclusion of the research phase.

The following document describes our methodology and results.

## Approach

The goal of every urban government is to provide residents a high quality of life, which not only includes the benefits associated with high-quality jobs, but also a vibrant economy filled with excellent amenities and supported by well-maintained infrastructure. Building a robust business tax base is one recognized strategy in California for cities to adequately fund general expenses and capital infrastructure, given, for example, state restrictions on property taxes. This strategy is particularly relevant to Stockton given its history of bankruptcy following the Recession and its "brain drain" challenge of keeping high-quality talent from leaving for economic opportunities in the Bay Area and elsewhere. One useful related indicator is the jobs to employed residents (J/ER) ratio; the higher this ratio, the greater the share of business and sales tax relative to property tax, and the less likely the region is a "bedroom community" in which there are more people at night than during the day. For reference, a city like San Jose is unique to have its metropolitan core location yet have a J/ER ratio less than 1; nearby cities like Palo Alto approach a J/ER ratio of 3. 

If Stockton is to reinvent its economy, a key goal should be to increase its J/ER ratio while ensuring the quality of those jobs. To do so, it must aggressively attract high-quality businesses and support the growth of its existing ones, so that its number of jobs may increase more quickly than its population. Historical data for both population and jobs will help us understand the baseline performance of Stockton and its surrounding region in this regard, as well as allow us to forecast what "business as usual" looks like into the future. Then, J/ER ratio targets can be set in comparison to business as usual, which can be achieved through the kinds of economic development strategies explored in this report.

Of course, both job and population growth directly impact a city's environmental footprint. In later sections, we will prepare a baseline assessment of Stockton's greenhouse gas inventory, our primary indicator of environmental performance. Importantly, GHGs should be disaggregated as much as possible into residential and non-residential (commercial, industrial, agricultural) sectors and normalized by respective populations (residents vs. workers) to understand the GHG use per capita in these different sectors. Stockton's GHG footprint will almost certainly increase in the coming decades simply due to the increase in jobs and population, but if GHG/capita for each sector can be reduced through the kinds of strategies explored in this report, then it should be considered successful in curbing GHGs -- and perhaps the City's GHG footprint may actually decrease as a whole.

So, in summary, an accurate assessment of current population and jobs, combined with a GHG inventory, helps us measure important indicators of success like J/ER and GHG/capita. And a best estimate of how population and jobs will change in the future shows us what business as usual looks like for both economic and environmental health. Given this outlook, Stockton can consider a wide range of possible strategies that stimulate job growth, reduce our environmental footprint, or in the best case scenario, achieve both at the same time, all categorized under the term **green economy**. The effects of those strategies can be modeled into the future in comparison to business as usual to see if they help us achieve our economic and environmental targets. Of course, strategies will also need to be evaluated based on their costs and return on investment, which we will approximate as a $/tCO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) in net-present value, similar to the work done in [Climate Smart San Jose](http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/75035). After robustly carrying out the quantitative analysis involved, this report will highlight the most promising strategies at the intersection of "green" and "economy" so that future decision-makers can take actionable steps towards a vibrant and sustainable future.

# Baseline Assessment

The first step to our research is to conduct a baseline assessment of Stockton's environmental and economic performance, and produce "business as usual" forecasts. Different datasets will be limited to different historical ranges and geographic scales. We will explain all key assumptions made in data processing. For forecasting, we will generally rely on simple regression and will project to 2040, a common planning horizon.

## Population and Jobs

The following analysis first processes population and jobs data at the County (SJC) level, where it is more readily available, followed by estimations at the City level. 

### County-level Analysis

The following datasets were collected for SJC:

- [Total Population, American Communities Survey, 1-Yr Estimates, 2010-2018](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)
- [Population projections for US counties, 2020-2100](https://osf.io/9ynfc/)
- [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics, 2010-2017](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/), available at the block level

A few notes on methodology and assumptions:

1. From the ACS, we collected Total Population, Total Population 16 and Older, Total Employed Residents (16+), and Unemployment Rate (for 16+). In order to forecast the future number of employed residents, which would then be used to forecast the future number of jobs, we chose to perform a linear regression on employment rate projecting to 2040, given that the unemployment rate was significantly more variable from 2010-2018.
2. Population projections come from a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20195) published in Nature in 2019. The specific methodology is beyond the scope of this project to unpack. What's notable is that five different projections were made by the author based on diferent "potential futures involving various growth policies, fossil-fuel usage, mitigation policies (ie emission reductions), adaptation policies (ie deployment of flood defenses), and population change". We used the "Middle of the road" projection.
3. Projections from the above study were available in 5-year age groups. While the total population projection is directly used in the final table below for SJC, Population of 15+ was also collected which was multiplied by the previously projected Employment Rate (#1) to forecast total Employed Residents. Note that given data limitations we have a discontinuity between Population 16+ data from 2010-2018 and Population 15+ data from 2020-2040. We assume this difference is negligible for the purposes of our analysis, but it would have the effect of overestimating job count.
4. From LODES we collected "Primary Jobs" at the block group level and aggregated all jobs for block groups in SJC. These are meant to match the number of individual workers in a region. We also compared this number to the number of employees provided by the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html) dataset and the number of nonemployer establishments in the [Nonemployer Statistics](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/nonemp-api.2017.html) dataset. The LODES Primary Jobs number was higher than the QWI Employee count but lower than the QWI Employee count plus Nonemployer Establishments count, which seems to make sense (since an individual could operate multiple nonemployer establishments).
5. We calculated J/ER for 2010-2018 by dividing total Jobs by Employed Residents. Then, we chose to perform a linear regression on J/ER ratio projecting to 2040, and multiplied this by our projected Employed Residents (#3) to forecast total Jobs.

### City-level Analysis

The Nature journal population projections from the previous section are not available at the City level; in this case we chose to assume that Stockton's missing data was proportional to the related data we had at the County level. Otherwise, to scale our analysis down to Stockton, we collected data at the blockgroup level. The following blockgroups were used to represent Stockton.

```{r}
stockton_boundary <- 
  places("CA", cb = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Stockton")

stockton_bgs_full <- 
  block_groups("CA", cb = TRUE)[stockton_boundary,c("GEOID")] %>% 
  filter(!(GEOID %in% c("060770040011","060770039001","060770041061","060770039001","060770039002","060770051311","060770051351","060770041022")))

mapview(stockton_bgs_full$geometry) + mapview(stockton_boundary, alpha.regions = 0, color = "red", lwd = 4)
```

Stockton's jobs to employed residents ratio trend for 2010-2018 is notable; while it has been higher overall than the County's J/ER ratio this decade, it has been trending slightly downwards where the County's has been trending upwards. One possible explanation would be that Stockton has received an influx of residents who are working outside of Stockton; perhaps such residents have been displaced further from their place of work, and have moved to Stockton where they could find more affordable housing. Further analysis would be necessary to test this explanation and others. It's also important to acknowledge that many good jobs held by Stockton residents may be just outside of official Stockton borders, in the industrial zones and neighboring cities, which still contribute to the local economy; that is why it's useful to look at both the city and county levels. But if this preliminary analysis is indicative of a growing imbalance, then Stockton should focus on aggressive strategies to reverse the trend and bring more quality jobs within its borders.

## Green Jobs

While there are many possible ways to identify "green jobs", this report uses the [Bureau of Labor Statistics Green Jobs Initiative](https://www.bls.gov/green/home.htm) classification of 333 NAICS industries which it has determined to potentially contain jobs that met its definition of green jobs:

- Jobs in businesses that produce goods or provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.
- Jobs in which workers' duties involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources.

Specifically, those 333 potential industries were classified into the following sub-categories:

- 58 in "Energy from renewable sources"
- 140 in "Energy efficiency"
- 124 in "Pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse gas reduction, and recycling and reuse"
- 75 in "Natural resource conservation"
- 45 in "Environmental compliance, education and training, and public awareness"

The following six tables filter the full Quarterly Workforce Indicators dataset to just the BLS-classified sectors, as well as further filtering in these five sub-categories. The top green job sectors span agriculture, building trades, and scientific research. This analysis is at the County level because the QWI data is only available at that scale.

## GHG Inventory

The State of California Governor's Office of Planning and Research recommends that California local governments follow ICLEI's [Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Protocol](http://icleiusa.org/) when undertaking their greenhouse gas emissions inventories. ICLEI helped to produce Stockton's most recent [GHG Inventory in 2016](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zbb6apJ1eAT0BgLPOmBE0IYkDKZooUhd) which was compared to the previous inventory produced by ICF for the 2005 baseline year.

It is not within the scope of this project to formally update the 2016 ICLEI GHG Inventory for 2018, which is best completed by ICLEI or another similar organization. In fact, many of the significant components of ICLEI's formal GHG analysis, like "Water Energy" for example, are simply based off of an interpolation of population changes, given the lack of official data -- in other words, it is similar to what we have already done to project GHGs to 2040. We believe the following three focus areas are essential:

1. Normalization of the emissions by the incremental unit of activity, which is usually population, to understand the baseline rate of GHG emissions per actor. Unless we intend to directly limit the number of actors, these activity emission rates are fundamentally the factors that determine how large Stockton's footprint is. The reduction of activity emissions rates therefore becomes the critical problem to solve, either through behavior change, technology, or other means. We have already normalized overall emission sectors by jobs and population, but to get to the level of concrete green economy strategies, we will need to disaggregate further by specific key activities. The next few sections pursue this goal, focusing on some of the largest emitting activities: passenger vehicle driving and building energy.
2. Focusing on activity emissions rates also requires having direct measurement data in those same activity sectors to be able to calibrate our rates. For the two sectors we will focus on in the subsequent sections, passenger vehicle driving and building energy, there are fortunately recent public data sources we can use to calibrate our baseline rates, and we can expect these data sources to be available in the future so we can check whether rates have fallen in the ways we will have been hoping for, given our various strategic interventions. Part of our contribution through this project is to prepare scripts that can more easily update measurements in the future as soon as new public data is available, so that feedback can be obtained as efficiently as possible. These scripts also essentially help to update the most significant components of an overall GHG inventory analysis.
3. Since the availability of direct measurement data is critical to both the updating of GHG inventories and the understanding of the efficacy of our investments, we should also seek to increase the availability of direct measurement data in the sectors in which it is less readily available. These areas include industrial energy consumption (which is often restricted because of the California Public Utilities Commission's 15/15 rule, which means that utilities cannot provide data at aggregations with fewer than 15 customers or one customer greater than 15% of usage), water consumption (given the existence of private water providers), and waste production specific to Stockton residents (given that data is collected at the landfill but isn't disaggregated by truck routes or individual properties). These are all areas with opportunity for novel data sharing agreements to be negotiated by the City (e.g. the [PG&E Green Communities Program](https://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/environment/whatyoucando/greencommunities/GreenCommunities_SummaryPlanningReports.pdf), which effectively will enlist PG&E to directly complete the 3 steps outlined here for Stockton's building energy sector), and these efforts will improve the overall green economy initiative.

The following table shows a preliminary normalization of the 2005 and 2016 GHG emissions by residents and jobs, using the following allocation:

- Residential Energy and Transportation were allocated entirely to residents
- Commercial Energy, Agriculture, and Fugitive Emissions were allocated entirely to jobs
- Solid Waste and Water/Wastewater were distributed proportionally between residents and jobs
- Industrial Energy was not included, given the significant difference in methodology between 2005 and 2016 as documented by ICLEI

*Table 12. Inventory Comparisons Stockton 2005-2016, normalized by residents and jobs. Industrial emissions were removed for this table because of the differences in methodology between 2005 and 2016.*

Based on the allocation assumptions, it appears that emissions per resident has decreased by 3.8% between 2005-2016, while emissions per job has decreased by 23%. These are both good signs, though there are gaps in the GHG inventories. Next, it is useful to drill down into the sub-sectors to reveal deeper insights.

## Vehicle Miles Traveled

As seen in the previous section, transportation is the largest single contributor of GHG emissions in Stockton, [as is true for all of California](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/ghg-inventory-data). Within this sector, passenger vehicle emissions are by far the largest portion, and these are relatively easy to relate to their direct proxy, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and normalize by drivers to understand current driving behavior. Specifically, commutes (driving to work) are the largest share of passenger vehicle emissions (other driving to/from amenities will be analyzed separately), and we can access data as recent as 2015 to understand commute patterns of Stockton residents to different job destinations in and around SJC. What we find is that VMT is significant, and significantly locked in to the nature of job opportunity in faraway locations like the Bay Area. This means that VMT reduction is a crucial component in any overall green economy strategy, and it can be tackled directly through transportation strategies like public transit and EV deployment, but also indirectly by attracting high-quality jobs to Stockton, which on average will shift workers from faraway jobs to local jobs, thereby reducing VMTs. A comprehensive origin-destination commute analysis, as performed below, helps us quantify total VMTs attributable to commuting as well as model the specific impacts of different direct or indirect VMT reduction strategies.

Our key dataset is from [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) (LODES), which can be downloaded by state and is available up to 2017. We isolated every pair of Stockton home blockgroups and work blockgroups and used the [Open Source Routing Machine](http://project-osrm.org/) to compute a distance (in miles) and duration (and hours) for a one-way trip. The following graph shows the distribution of workplaces by distance from home for Stockton residents.

*Figure 7. Distribution of workplaces by distance from home for Stockton employed residents. Trips greater than 3 hours are removed. Data from LODES, 2017.*

Some reported workplaces in LODES are as far away as Los Angeles County and are likely data errors (e.g. the company headquarters is in Los Angeles but the actual workplace is much closer, or the employee works from home). The graph above, and our subsequent analysis, focuses on counties with average commute times of less than 3 hours, which eliminates the unrealistic commutes while preserving ~94% of reported commutes.

The LODES dataset also disaggregates jobs by three age groups:

- Number of jobs of workers age 29 or younger
- Number of jobs for workers age 30 to 54
- Number of jobs for workers age 55 or older

It also disaggregates jobs by three wage tiers:

- Number of jobs with earnings $1250/month or less
- Number of jobs with earnings \$1251/month to $3333/month
- Number of jobs with earnings greater than $3333/month 

It also disaggregates jobs by three broad sectors:

- Number of jobs in Goods Producing industry sectors
- Number of jobs in Trade, Transportation, and Utilities industry sectors
- Number of jobs in All Other Services industry sectors

The following table shows the counts of jobs in these subcategories for the top 15 contiguous neighboring counties to Stockton, including SJC.

While LODES origin-destination data doesn't provide job types at a granularity lower than the three broad categories in the previous three maps, one possible assumption to make is that the distribution of NAICS industry sectors in a destination block group, which is available through the separate Workplace Area Characteristics dataset from LODES, is the same distribution for specifically Stockton residents who work in that block group. Using this assumption, we created estimates of the locations of specific types of industries and wage levels for Stockton employed residents.

The percentages in the table below should be interpreted as the % of overall jobs of that industry sector and wage tier that are based in San Joaquin County (the remainder being based in other counties). Particularly notable here are the low-percentage estimates of high-wage jobs in sectors generally related to the "knowledge economy": Finance and Insurance (38%), Information (28%), and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (19%). Also notable is the low percentage of high-wage jobs in Construction (35%), which may include specialized building trades such as solar installation. These percentages are relative to an overall 64% of high-wage jobs being based in SJC, which suggests that the best jobs in these notable industries are significantly underrepresented in the local economy.

Note that for high-wage jobs in Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, San Joaquin County isn't even the top employer of Stockton residents. 

We estimated the total and average GHG emissions for Stockton workers commuting to each of the top 15 counties (filtering out counties further than 3 hours away). We made the following assumptions:

- For each origin-destination block group pair, we used ACS 1-yr 2017 data on commute mode by travel time for the origin block group to estimate a share of travelers commuting by single occupancy vehicle and by carpooling, and applied this factor to the count of jobs from LODES to estimate a total number of vehicle trips and vehicle mildes traveled (VMT).
- For carpool trips, we counted 2-person carpools as 1 vehicle for every 2 jobs, and 3-or-more-person carpools as 1 vehicle for every 3 jobs.
- For daily VMT, each vehicle was assumed to take 2 one-way trips.
- To convert daily VMT to annual VMT, the same annualization factor was used as ICLEI: 369.39. The factor appears to account for both expected reductions in VMT because of sick days, as well as expected increases in VMT because of chained trips.
- All vehicles were assumed to be passenger vehicles with an average mpg of 29.2 in 2017 and CO2e emissions of 303 g/mi (0.000334 tCO2e/mi), using data from the [EPA Automotive Trends Report](https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data). Disregarding SUVs and trucks has the effect of underestimating emissions.

*Table 15. Top 15 Counties where Stockton Residents Work, Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Data from LODES, 2017.*

According to the table above, 59% percent of Stockton residents work in San Joaquin County and collectively contribute 18% of all commute GHGs. The next 14 counties comprise another 38% of Stockton residents, but they collectively contribute 76% of all commute GHGs. This significant difference comes down to difference in average commute distance to each county, which is directly related to average GHG emissions per worker, as seen in the following map. In a later section, we will explore opportunities to stimulate local job creation so that some of these long-distance commutes can be converted into local commutes, reducing both the toll on the environment and the tolls on health and well-being for Stockton residents.

To conclude this section, we used LODES and ACS data from 2013-2017 to estimate the change in VMT over that time period. Since our specific VMT methodology includes many simplifying assumptions, it is perhaps most valuable to see the change in VMT using a constant methodology over time.

The average one-way commute trip for the Stockton worker appears to have increased by 26% over the last 6 years. This could be explained by existing residents changing to jobs that are further and further away from home, where better employment opportunities can be found, and by new residents moving to Stockton to find affordable housing but retaining their faraway jobs.

## Energy

After transportation, buildings are the next largest source of emissions based on the ICLEI GHG inventories. Our best source of energy data is from [PG&E's Energy Data Request Program](https://pge-energydatarequest.com/public_datasets), which provides total customers, total kWh of electricity, and total therms of gas usage per zipcode per month dating back to 2013. We used the following ZCTAs, close proxies of customer zip codes, to represent Stockton.

```{r}
zcta <- zctas(starts_with="95") %>% 
  mutate(ZCTA5CE10 = as.numeric(ZCTA5CE10))
# zips_stockton <- st_read("C:/Users/derek/Google Drive/City Systems/Stockton Green Economy/ZipCodes/ZipCodes.shp") %>% st_transform(st_crs(zcta)) #this was downloaded from Stockton GIS site to do a quick visual check of the difference between ZCTA and zip code. We determined they were pretty much the same.

stockton_boundary_influence <- st_read("C:/Users/derek/Google Drive/City Systems/Stockton Green Economy/SpheresOfInfluence/SpheresOfInfluence.shp", quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(SPHERE == "STOCKTON") %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(zcta)) #stockton boundary is legit but really spotty, so i prefer using sphere of influence from the County GIS page.

#2 of the 3 shapes are tiny little triangles to get rid of.
stockton_boundary_influence <- stockton_boundary_influence[1,] 

zcta_stockton <- zcta[stockton_boundary_influence,] %>% 
  filter(!ZCTA5CE10 %in% c("95242","95240","95336","95330")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(ZCTA5CE10) %>% 
  rename(ZIPCODE = ZCTA5CE10) %>% 
  mutate(ZIPCODE = as.numeric(ZIPCODE))
  #these are some extraneous zip codes that just barely touch the sphere of influence that i manually decided to remove.
# zcta_stockton <- zcta[which(zcta$ZCTA5CE10 %in% st_centroid(zcta)[stockton_boundary_influence,]$ZCTA5CE10),] #this would be the go-to script to do a location by centroid within, but it's not as useful in this specific case.

mapview(zcta_stockton$geometry) + mapview(stockton_boundary, alpha.regions = 0, color = "red", lwd = 4)

PG&E's data had some minor formatting errors that were manually corrected:

- For 2014 Q3 Gas, fields "Total Therms" and "Average Therms" renamed to match the fields in all other datasets.
- For 2017 Q4 Electricity and 2017 Q4 Gas, duplicate September values were removed.

Also, because of privacy regulations, the PG&E data has many gaps in industrial and agricultural energy usage. Even though industrial energy usage may be a significant contributors to emissions, as the ICLEI report suggests, without more consistent data we decided to leave industrial energy analysis out of our report. 

After downloading and aggregating the PG&E residential and commercial data by month and year, we converted electricity and gas energy usage to tCO2e. For gas, we converted therms to tCO2e based a factor from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php) (assuming that PG&E’s natural gas emits at this rate, and that it doesn’t change from year to year). For electricity, we converted kWh to tCO2e for the appropriate year using the table provided by PG&E in their [2019 Corporate Responsibility Report](http://www.pgecorp.com/corp_responsibility/reports/2019/en02_climate_change.html), under the table titled “Benchmarking Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Delivered Electricity”. Because the latest emissions data is 210 lbs CO2 per MWh for 2017, and SB 100 signed into law September 2018 requires state energy agencies to adopt a 100 percent clean energy by 2045 planning goal, we assume the emissions factor will decrease by 7.5 lbs CO2 per MWh each here, resulting in a value of 202.5 for 2018.

The following graph plots monthly tCO2e for electricity vs. gas. The peaks in gas usage occur in January, corresponding to heating load, and the peaks in electricity usage occur in July, corresponding to cooling load, and overall decreasing as previously noted. As we'll explore in a later section, electrification of air and water heating in buildings may be a particularly effective strategy to shift the peak gas consumption to less carbon-intensive electricity loads.

Note that heating and cooling loads, which appear to contribute to significant seasonal variation within years, is also heavily dependent on the specific weather in any given year, typically measured in heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs). A more accurate comparison of annual energy consumption would control for change in HDDs and CDDs year-to-year; a more accurate forecasting of energy consumption into the future would also factor in climate model predictions of future HDDs and CDDs.

We used the [Cal-Adapt Degree Day tool](https://cal-adapt.org/tools/degree-days) to collect HDDs and CDDs for Stockton from 2013 to 2018, and on to 2040, using the average simulation (CanESM2) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario (in which global GHG emissions peak around 2040, then decline). The graph below shows the data from Cal-Adapt, as well as linear trendlines, with a clear overall upwards trend for CDDs (meaning that temperatures are rising and more cooling power is needed), and a clear overall downwards trend for HDDs. 

```{r}

The following table shows historical 2013-2018 annual energy usage per capita (residents for residential energy, jobs for commercial energy) per degree day (HDDs for gas, CDDs for electricity), and the graph that follows shows these four energy use factors with downward trends. This may be through a combination of changing building energy efficiency as well as changing building utilization (e.g. more or less space per occupant), though we don't have the data to be able to separate these two factors.

A full forecast of energy usage will also depend on predicted changes in resident and job populations, which will lead to more buildings and more energy used in buildings, predicted changes in building energy efficiency and utilization, predicted changes in weather, and many other factors that are outside the scope of this analysis. One last available dataset to incorporate into our understanding of energy use relates to buildings.

## Buildings

2018 data from the local County Assessor's Office includes property use type and total building square footage for every parcel in Stockton. Because the assessor's record of total building square footage is of poor quality, we chose to instead use [Microsoft's U.S. Building Footprint Data](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints), joined each building footprint to a parcel (thereby also assigning a residential or commercial type based on the zoning of the parcel), and multiplied this footprint area by number of stories if it was recorded on the assessor's record. This dataset may still contain significant errors (e.g. mixed use parcels are mis-identified, the stories record may be incorrect, Microsoft's building footprints may be incorrect, etc.), but we decided it was the best representation of total building square footage in Stockton. 

The following maps show the density of residents per 1000 sqft of residential buildings across Stockton, followed by the density of jobs per 1000 sqft of commercials buildings, at the block group level. Residential population was obtained from ACS 2017 5-yr data, and job count was obtained from LODES 2017.

Because we do not have robust historical building datasets, we cannot analyze the change in building square footages over time. For forecasting, we  assume an overall fixed building utilization estimate of 1.7 residents per 1000 sqft of residential buildings, and 1.3 jobs per 1000 sqft of commercial buildings. In the intervention stage, if we expect a strategy would change building utilization, we would make a reduction in energy consumption relative to these baseline utilization rates.

As one last couple of building-specific analyses, we aggregated building square footage information up to the zipcode level and compared with energy usage data to see residential and commercial building energy efficiency at a recent snapshot of time as spatially distributed in Stockton.

## GHG Forecast

For our "business as usual" forecast og GHG emissions through 2040, and for our subsequent exploration of intervention strategies, we will focus on the following sectors for which we have used available data to refine our models: transportation, commercial energy, and residential energy. These sectors represented 58% of ICLEI's modeled emissions in 2016. The other sectors, particularly industrial energy which comprised 24% of 2016 emissions, are also significant opportunities for GHG reductions, but are outside of the scope of this analysis without better data.

Our simplified model of transportation emissions assumes that commute one-way vehicle miles traveled per worker is on a linear trend based on recent data. Otherwise, our forecasts of growth in the number of employed residents drives changes in VMT and thus transportation emissions. Other "business as usual" factors, like a forecasted adoption of EVs, are not considered in this analysis.

Our simplified model of energy emissions will assume that building square footage increases with population and job growth through fixed ratios, and an underlying energy use factor for commercial and residential electricity and gas will follow the same trends as the last six years through 2040. Otherwise, a basic climate change model will drive additional changes in the forecasts.

In summary, the following assumptions go into inputs for the forecasts, which are also shown in the table below:

- From Section 2.1, we derived future population, employed resident, and job forecasts, specifically for the years 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040.
- From Section 2.4, we derived commute one-way VMT/workers for 2011-2017, and projected a linear trend to 2040.
- From Section 2.4, we derived simplified aggregate vehicle emission rates for San Joaquin County through 2040.
- From Section 2.5, we derived a linear forecast of PG&E's electricity emissions factor which runs from 2017's data point towards a 2045 target of 100% clean energy.
- From Section 2.5, we derived linear forecasts of heating and cooling degree days through 2040 from Cal-Adapt's HDD and CDD projections.
- From Section 2.5, we derived linear forecasts of energy use per capita per degree-day through 2040. For Commercial Gas, we leveled out the forecast at 1 kBTU/job/HDD from 2035 on.
