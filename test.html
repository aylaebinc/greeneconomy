<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Building Utilization</h2>
<p>Building Utilization refers to the amount of building space used per person throughout their daily activities. Specific types of building energy uses like heating and cooling are proportional to space use, and strategies to reduce the amount of space required per person, whether at home or at work, that do not sacrifice comfort can be effective ways to reduce emissions. However, the more profound impact of space efficiency is the densification of all urban activities, which may have an even greater emissions impact by reducing travel distances, as well as many potential social co-benefits.</p>

<td align="left">In California, taxpayers with 20 or fewer employees at the end of the preceding taxable year may qualify for a nonrefundable new jobs credit against the personal income tax and corporation franchise and income taxes for each new qualified employee that is hired. It is equal to $3,000 for each net increase in qualified full-time employees from the previous taxable year. It is only applicable to firms with 20 or fewer employees (see Sec. 23623, California Rev. &amp; Tax. Code).

<td align="left">The draft plan presented here is a no-growth network plan, which means it is designed to use existing METRO operating funds. The plan reallocates existing service rather than imagining new resources. That’s why the plan doesn’t always offer as much service as METRO or its customers would like. Nearly all (94%) current riders will be able to access service at the same stop they do now. The vast majority of current riders (72% up from 49.5% on weekdays and 25% on weekends) will be on or near frequent service that is useful for travel to more places than they can reach easily now. Even if you are already on a frequent line, the plan makes it much easier to transfer to other lines to get to more places. 99.5% of existing riders will have local bus service within 1/4 mile. The small percentage that will be farther from service either live or travelc in areas where the pattern of development and the street network make it impossible to run transit efficiently, and as a result they could only be served at a very high cost per rider. About 0.6% of existing riders will have flexible service rather than fixed route service. This service will provide hourly pickups and dropoffs within its defined zone and to reach a point where you can connet to fixed route service. Riders can call ahead to reserve a ride on the service or meet the bus at a designated location and time. Some fixed routes will still run in these zones, but the flexible service will fill in the gaps for those who might find it difficult to walk to a bus stop.</td>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.1</span> Strategy: Building Electrification</h3>
<p><a href="https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Economic_Benefits_of_Energy_Efficiency_Programs.pdf">Economic Benefits of Energy Efficiency Programs: A Case Study of Investments by the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power</a> by the UCLA Luskin Center estimates the economic benefits of LADWP’s energy efficiency programs through the metrics of number of jobs, value added (e.g. income for workers, profits for businesses, and taxes for local government), and labor income.</p>
<p>The report notes that for every dollar invested by LADWP ($123M for FY 2016-17: - $0.53 in energy cost savings for customers per year (for the lifetime of the measure). Much of these energy cost savings then get reinvested back in the local economy. - $0.43 co-invested by local businesses and households (total $53M for FY 2016-17) through financial inventive programs which require participants to provide matching funds for their energy efficient purchase or upgrade. - $1.36 value added (labor income, profits, and taxes) - For every $1M dollars of LADWP investment, 13.5 FTE job-years in LA County are supported (1658 total).</p>
<p>One of the limitations of the study is described as follows: “… the ultimate merit of each program should not be solely evaluated in terms of jobs or wealth generation. When making investment decisions, utilities must consider a number of factors, including statuary compliance, grid reliability, costs for ratepayers, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, and associated improvements in air quality. Programs that have a low employment or value added multiplier may perform better according to other co-benefits, such as reducing pollution and improving associated environmental health outcomes. Broader analysis of the many co-benefits associated with energy efficiency programs is another worthy task for future research.”</p>
<p>Along these lines, we were particularly interested evaluating these programs in terms of net economic cost for GHGs saved, or $/tCO2e, similar to <a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/environment/climate-smart-san-jos">Climate Smart San Jose</a>. In the Luskin report, estimates of energy savings were only given as a 1-yr amount from FY 2016-17 in kWh. It is unclear in each example what combination of electricity and gas savings this entails, and no indication is given of the likely duration of these energy savings, which would be dependent on many factors including the lifetime of the appliance/product. The economic figures, such as the numbers presented above, also come with many model limitations which are described in the report, but appear to be interpretable as the net present value of all total impacts to be realized at some point in the future. Given these interpretations, we estimated net economic cost as investment (by LADWP and co-investors) minus value added to economy and net present value of energy savings. The lifetime of the measure was generally assumed to be 10 years, with the exception of the Refigerator Turn-In &amp; Recycle program which was assumed to be 2.5 years (the amount of time a homeowner may keep using an old fridge instead of retiring it). A 3% real discount rate was applied in the NPV calculations. Total tCO2e reduction was estimated by assuming the annual kWh savings could be realized in PG&amp;E’s territory from 2020 onward for the lifetime of the measure, factoring in the emissions factors used in this report.</p>

<p>Almost all the programs studied in the Luskin report have a negative net cost per tCO2e, meaning they provide a net economic benefit (note that this is not profit solely recuperated to the original investors, but distributed throughout the economy). Programs should ultimately be evaluated based on the feasibility of the original government investment, the $/tCO2e, and the total tCO2e reduction that can be achieved through the measure.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.3</span> Case Study: Direct Connect in Pinellas County, FL</h3>
<p>The Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA), in Pinellas County, FL, was the first transit agency in the US to sign a service provision agreement with a transportation network company (TNC) to offer joint first/last-mile service subsidized by public dollars. PSTA’s “Direct Connect” pilot allows riders to get to and from bus stops in a taxi, wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV), or Uber TNC vehicle at a subsidized rate. From August 2017 to March 2018, Uber trips taken via the service (beginning or ending within 800 feet of eight pilot transit stops) were subsidized on average from $7.64 to $2.64 per ride. The Shared Use Mobility Center conducted a <a href="https://learn.sharedusemobilitycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SUMC_CaseStudy_Final3_06.21.19-1.pdf">program evaluation</a> in 2019 and outlined key lessons learned, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of leadersihp within the transit agency, and the strong coordination of key staff members in charge of the project.</li>
<li>Heavy investment in public outreach about the program.</li>
<li>A common contract for multiple potential TNCs to compete within the program.</li>
<li>Negotiating greater data sharing from the TNC and direct investment in other forms of program data, such as user surveys.</li>
<li>Identifying clear performance goals to monitor over the project.</li>
<li>Refining the financial model and preparing for greater subsidy costs as TNC business models evolve.</li>
</ul>

<div id="strategy-public-transit" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.4</span> Strategy: Public Transit</h3>
<p>In 2019, San Joaquin Regional Transit District released its <a href="http://sanjoaquinrtd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRTP-2018-Update_FINAL.pdf">Short Range Transit Plan</a> for 18/19-27/28. Generally, RTD suffered service reductions after the financial recession but is expecting to be able to regain ground and expand service during this next phase. There are currently 128 active vehicles and 203 employees. Proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines throughout Stockton include CO2 reduction projections. For new service, the capital cost of a new vehicle is about $1M, and capital infrastructure costs are about $500K per stop, and annual operating costs are $600-800M per vehicle.</p>
<p>In June of 2018, RTD formed a partnership with PG&amp;E to conduct an electric vehicle pilot to support RTD’s long-term electric transportation needs with chargers and infrastructure improvements. This pilot will be a test case for PG&amp;E’s new FleetReady program, which supports electric charging for customers with medium-duty, heavy-duty, and off-road fleets. For this new pilot, PG&amp;E will test how smart charging and battery storage can lower operating costs and maximize efficiencies. As RTD transitions to an electric fleet, it will need to purchase electric station infrastructure for the RTC.</p>
<p>RTD has also piloted a variety of mobility management services which act as alternatives to fixed-line service, and expects to expand these, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>RTD Go! On July 10, 2017, RTD Go-in partnership with Uber and Journey Via Gurney (JVG)-replaced the former General Public Dial-A-Ride service that operated countywide with a primary focus in rural areas. RTD Go provides public transit connectivity to residents of rural areas of the county where traditional bus service is not practical. This program extends service hours beyond fixed-route hours and offers an innovative mobility option to the public. By partnering with transportation network company Uber, RTD Go provides on-demand transportation that is subsidized 50%, up to $5 per trip. For customers with physical disabilities or other limitations, RTD Go partnered with accessible service provider, JVG, to provide transportation at a $10 flat fare per trip.</li>
<li>When designing Commuter routes, RTD evaluates the origins and destinations using data from SJCOG’s Dibs (formerly Commute Connection) program and current and potential employers. There are emerging needs for the creation of corridor service with multiple trips between Stockton, Lodi, and downtown Sacramento-initially with weekday service, expanding to a seven-days-a-week operation. Additionally, with weekend service to Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station, there is a need to expand the Commuter route to provide better connectivity to Manteca, Escalon, and Ripon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local public transit improvements will be modeled as reductions on local amenity VMT, while specific proposed commuter routes will be modeled as reductions on commute VMT.</p>

<div id="strategy-demand-response" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.5</span> Strategy: Demand Response</h3>
<p>DR load reductions are of short duration and are made either the day before or the day of a DR program event. In contrast to energy efficiency and traditional time-of-use measures, DR represents the “need of the hour”- the critical period when businesses can mitigate adverse pricing or power system conditions. For instance, DR is most likely to be requested for a few hours between 12 P.M. and 6 P.M., on a hot summer afternoon, when electric demand is generally highest. The figure below illustrates the performance for an example facility participating in a DR event during the period between 2 P.M. and 6 P.M.</p>
<p>Company-led initiatives: PG&amp;E documented pilots with <a href="https://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/energysavingsrebates/demandresponse/cs/HealthCare_CommunityMedicalCenters_DR_CaseStudy.pdf">Community Medical Centers</a> in 2006. The centers identified these measures for the summer’s first DR event:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise chiller temperature 5 degrees F</li>
<li>Shut down the redundant chiller water loop</li>
<li>Shut off redundant water pumps</li>
<li>Shut down some visitor elevators</li>
<li>Use EMS systems to turn off 50% of non-essential lights</li>
<li>Shut off booster pumps for outdoor watering</li>
<li>Shut off one boiler in order to turn off associated fans</li>
<li>Turn off cooking equipment and serve cold food (sandwiches and salads) in the Visitor Cafeteria</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest hospital, whose typical summer peak demand is between 4578 kW and 4664 kW, dropped more than 500 kW over two to six hour periods on three event days.</p>
<p>A private company, <a href="https://www.ohmconnect.com/how-it-works/impact">OhmConnect</a>, allows individual residential customers to also participate in DR. Stockton could explore cleantech competition in this space or supplementary programs for existing services, such as a focus on introducing more “smart appliances” into the market that can more easily participate in DR. The greatest impact is likely in targeting specific large employers for customized DR programs and rewarding/recognizing them for program outcomes, thereby positioning the local economy as a champion and leader in active energy emissions reduction.</p>
