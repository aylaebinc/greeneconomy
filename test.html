<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Building Utilization</h2>
<p>Building Utilization refers to the amount of building space used per person throughout their daily activities. Specific types of building energy uses like heating and cooling are proportional to space use, and strategies to reduce the amount of space required per person, whether at home or at work, that do not sacrifice comfort can be effective ways to reduce emissions. However, the more profound impact of space efficiency is the densification of all urban activities, which may have an even greater emissions impact by reducing travel distances, as well as many potential social co-benefits.</p>

<td>Taxpayers with 20 or fewer employees at the end of the preceding taxable year may qualify for a nonrefundable new jobs credit against the personal income tax and corporation franchise and income taxes for each new qualified employee that is hired. It is equal to $3,000 for each net increase in qualified full-time employees from the previous taxable year. There have been several proposals for implementing a similar system with local corporate taxes.</td>

Many of these workers, however, would have been hired without the credit. It is likely that as firm size grows, economies of scale will allow job creation to increase exponentially as the marginal cost of adding an additional employee decreases.</td>

<td>Mortgage refinancing encourages consumers to take out a new loan to take advantage of lower interest rates. This creates a wealth effect whereby they develop greater disposable income. From a Keynesian perspective, this leads to more consumer spending in the local economy. The corollary to this is that growth in aggregate demand leads to job growth, or at least stability. HUD has a class on First-Time Homebuyer Education and Counseling.</td>

<td>In post-Keynesian thought, the job creation element of a public employment program is two-fold. On one hand, you are giving participants a job. On the other hand, their increase in discretionary income leads to greater aggregate spending and by extension, an increase demand for employment in sectors where money is being spent. Additionally, due to macroeconomic overemployment, it is important to target such a program to those who experience structural unemployment, not frictional.</td>
