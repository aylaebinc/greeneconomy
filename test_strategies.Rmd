# Test

## Building Utilization

Building Utilization refers to the amount of building space used per person throughout their daily activities. Specific types of building energy uses like heating and cooling are proportional to space use, and strategies to reduce the amount of space required per person, whether at home or at work, that do not sacrifice comfort can be effective ways to reduce emissions. However, the more profound impact of space efficiency is the densification of all urban activities, which may have an even greater emissions impact by reducing travel distances, as well as many potential social co-benefits. 

### Revise zoning codes in medium to large cities to facilitate upzoning
| Location | Oregon |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | HB 2001 legalizes the development of duplexes on residential land currently zoned for single-family housing in all communities of 10,000 or more. It also allows for the construction of three- to four-unit homes on single family-zoned land in cities of 25,000 or more. |
| Links | [Oregon Legislative Assembly](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2001/B-Engrossed) |
| Implementation Costs | N/A |
| Impact Factor | Fiscally, [50% of Oregon households](https://www.oregon.gov/OHA/PH/ABOUT/Documents/indicators/rentburden.pdf) are rent burdened while [23%](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/SHP_OR.pdf) of renter households are extremely low income. These individuals will likely see the biggest impact. However, the law applies to cities of over 10,000. As of the 2010 Census, 2,208,732 Oregonians, which constitute 57.65% of the state’s population, live in such communities. |
| Scalable Potential | Much of Stockton is [low density residential](https://stocktonca.mapgeo.io/datasets/properties?abuttersDistance=100&latlng=37.973764%2C-121.284422&themes=%22%5B%5C%22zoning%5C%22%5D%22&zoom=12). |

### Eliminate minimum parking
| Location | Buffalo, NY |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Developers are no longer required to build a certain number of parking spaces for commercial or residential projects, regardless of whether or not there are mass transit options nearby or if the tenants even need them. |
| Links | [Buffalo Green Code Land Use Plan](http://www.oneregionforward.org/plan/the-buffalo-green-code-draft-land-use-plan/) |
| Implementation Costs | N/A |
| Impact Factor | 28% of land area in Buffalo’s city center is devoted to parking but only 63% of parking spaces are occupied on an average weekday. |
| Scalable Potential | According to [Stockton’s zoning ordinance](http://qcode.us/codes/stockton/view.php?topic=16-3-16_64-16_64_040&frames=on), large shopping centers must build 1 parking space per 250 square feet of retail space. [Anecdotal evidence](https://stocktoncitylimits.com/2013/12/31/why-are-stocktons-parking-lots-so-big-and-empty/) suggests that this is too much space, even during peak hours. Similarly inefficient standards include that colleges and universities must have 1 parking space per classroom plus 0.75 spaces per student. |
